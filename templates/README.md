## Description

Briefly tell users why they might want to use your module. Explain what your
module does and what kind of problems users can solve with it.

This should be a fairly short description helps the user decide if your module
is what they want.

## Setup

### What "module name" affects **OPTIONAL**

If it's obvious what your module touches, you can skip this section. For
example, folks can probably figure out that your mysql_instance module affects
their MySQL instances.

If there's more that they should know about, though, this is the place to
mention:

* Files, packages, services, or operations that the module will alter, impact,
  or execute.
* Dependencies that your module automatically installs.
* Warnings or other important notices.

### Setup Requirements **OPTIONAL**

If your module requires anything extra before setting up (pluginsync enabled,
another module, etc.), mention it here.

If your most recent release breaks compatibility or requires particular steps
for upgrading, you might want to include an additional "Upgrading" section here.

### Beginning with "module name"

The very basic steps needed for a user to get the module up and running. This
can include setup steps, if necessary, or it can be an example of the most basic
use of the module.

## Usage

Include usage examples for common use cases in the **Usage** section. Show your
users how to use your module to solve problems, and be sure to include code
examples. Include three to five examples of the most important or common tasks a
user can accomplish with your module. Show users how to accomplish more complex
tasks that involve different types, classes, and functions working in tandem.

## Limitations

In the Limitations section, list any incompatibilities, known issues, or other
warnings.

## Development

In the Development section, tell other users the ground rules for contributing
to your project and how they should submit their work.
